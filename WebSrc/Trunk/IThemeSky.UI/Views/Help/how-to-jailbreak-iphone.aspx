					<p>This iPhone Jailbreak guide has been completely renovated to reflect better, and more current information on how to Jailbreak iPhone.</p>
					<h4>What is iPhone Jailbreak?</h4>
					<p>In short, Jailbreak is the process of hacking an iPhone to free it from Apple restrictions. </p>
					<p>Because the iPhone is far from flawless as Apple created it, thousands of iPhone users have flocked to Jailbreak in search of iPhone changes and improvements. iPhone has been held back by limited customizability, <a href="http://www.appleiphonereview.com/news/how-has-iphones-sms-preview-gotten-you-into-trouble/" target="_blank" class="linkEct"  rel="nofollow">text message privacy issues</a>, and a lack of multitasking capabilities. But Jailbreak can solve all of these problems with apps and fixes available in Cydia and Installer. </p>
					
					<p>Cydia and Installer are the unofficial &#8220;App Stores&#8221; of the Jailbreak world. Developers create apps and tweaks and different utilities and upload them to these package managers, which organize everything into categories. The differences between Cydia and the App Store are the lack of an <a href="http://www.appleiphonereview.com/news/4-ways-for-apple-to-fix-the-app-store-approval-process/" target="_blank" class="linkEct"  rel="nofollow">app approval process</a>, and the lack of access limits on the iPhone software &#8212; i.e. you can do things Apple did not design the iPhone software to do.</p>
					<h4>Why Jailbreak iPhone?</h4>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>No restrictions.</strong> Want a custom wallpaper on your home screen? Custom icons for your apps? Internet tethering? A category system for organizing your apps? The ability to hide native iPhone apps you don&#8217;t use? You can do all of this and more with Jailbreak, as iSmashPhone describes in <a href="http://www.ismashphone.com/2008/09/jailbreaik-reas.html" target="_blank" class="linkEct"  rel="nofollow">ten reasons to Jailbreak your iPhone</a>. As one of my readers recently noted, Jailbreak can make all your <a href="http://www.appleiphonereview.com/reviews/my-top-10-iphone-wishes-for-2010/" target="_blank" class="linkEct"  rel="nofollow">iPhone wishes</a> come true.</li>
						
						<li><strong>To join the subculture.</strong> Sick of Apple&#8217;s stranglehold on the iPhone? Those who Jailbreak iPhone belong to a movement of people who demand more from their iPhones. And they&#8217;re not gonna let Apple stop them. Beat the system: Jailbreak your iPhone.</li>
						<li><strong>Unlock iPhone.</strong> To unlock your iPhone and use it on any carrier, you must first Jailbreak your iPhone. Some of the Jailbreak solutions below also allow you to unlock the iPhone, though unlocking is generally beyond the scope of this tutorial. </li>
					</ol>
					<h4>Why NOT Jailbreak iPhone?</h4>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>The folks at Apple know what they are doing.</strong> They have not enabled multasking &#8212; the ability for apps to run in the background, simultaneously &#8212; most likely because it is a huge battery drain. By controlling the user experience, Apple ensures that your iPhone &#8220;just works,&#8221; and you don&#8217;t have to worry about managing battery life or any other technical details.</li>
						
						<li><strong>Jailbreak could (maybe?) brick your iPhone.</strong> &#8220;When someone develops something for an Apple product and that development isn’t sanctioned by Apple, you run the risk of it not working as it should, conflicting with the device itself, or just all-around bricking that iPhone,&#8221; warns <a href="http://chris.pirillo.com/what-is-iphone-jailbreak/" target="_blank" class="linkEct"  rel="nofollow">Chris Pirillo</a>, who prefers not to Jailbreak his iPhone because &#8220;my iPhone just works already.&#8221; But I have never heard of Jailbreak completely ruining an iPhone. The consensus at this forum seems to be that the chance is &#8220;extremely slim.&#8221;</li>
						<li><strong>Every iPhone update from iTunes disables Jailbreak.</strong> Every time Apple comes out with an update for iPhone, they find a way to prevent hackers from cracking the code again. Hackers then scramble to Jailbreak the iPhone again and release the new methods. That means if you like to download Apple&#8217;s iPhone updates, you are going to have to figure out each time how to Jailbreak your iPhone yes again. Do you really want to play this cat and mouse game?</li>
						
						<li><strong>Jailbreak might increase your risk of getting a virus on your iPhone.</strong> The only <a href="http://www.boygeniusreport.com/2009/11/12/second-iphone-virus-found-again-targets-jailbroken-iphones/" target="_blank" class="linkEct" rel="nofollow">two iPhone viruses</a> ever reported have spread across iPhones that have been Jailbroken. That&#8217;s not to say the iPhone platform as Apple built it is totally secure. In fact, some say compromising an iPhone&#8217;s security is &#8220;<a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2009/07/23/iphone-security-broken-business-users-take-note/" target="_blank" class="linkEct"  rel="nofollow">child&#8217;s play</a>&#8221; (i.e. easy).</li>
						<li><strong>Jailbreak voids your iPhone warranty.</strong> If your iPhone is bricked because of Jailbreak, or if your iPhone has another problem and it happens to be Jailbreaked, your warranty becomes void. I once saw a sign at the Genius bar of The Falls, Miami Apple Store that warned customers not to Jailbreak iPhones or they would void their warranties. Harsh.</li>
					</ol>
					<h4>iPhone Jailbreak Guides</h4>
					<p>Admittedly, I have in the past mused about whether Jailbreak is really <a href="http://www.appleiphonereview.com/news/iphone-jailbreak-worth-it/" target="_blank" class="linkEct" rel="nofollow">worth the trouble</a>, but the real problem is the hassle of finding accurate, helpful information on how to Jailbreak iPhone.</p>
					<p>I believe my old, <a href="http://www.appleiphonereview.com/how-to-jailbreak-your-iphone-in-under-a-minute/" target="_blank" class="linkEct"  rel="nofollow">outdated post</a> on iPhone Jailbreak was beginning to cause confusion for new visitors, so I have put together this <strong>The Ultimate Guide to iPhone Jailbreak</strong>. I have included textual resources from various sources, and also some videos on how to Jailbreak iPhone. </p>
					
					<p>Note: I have not attempted all of these iPhone Jailbreak instructions, I am merely compiling what information I have found and selected with my best judgment. Let me know what is helpful and what is not. </p>
					<h4>Text Resources</h4>
					<p>These websites contain information and download links necessary for various iPhone models with different OS versions. <strong>To see what version of the iPhone OS (operating system) you are running, go to Settings &gt;&gt; General &gt;&gt; About</strong>.</p>
					<p>Choose the iPhone Jailbreak guide that is right for you. Read everything extremely carefully, including comments, before attempting to Jailbreak. I have not personally attempted all of these, so you are Jailbreaking at your own risk.</p>

					<h4>ZiPhone Jailbreak is history</h4>					
					<p>I made this video a couple of years ago to demonstrate how easy it was to Jailbreak with ZiPhone. ZiPhone is now obsolete, so please do not try to use it. This video has been posted here for historical and humorous purposes only. Again, do not attempt to use ZiPhone! </p>

					<h4>Conclusion</h4>
					<p>iPhone offers endless possibilities for expressing the human imagination, but Apple restrictions hold us back. iPhone Jailbreak frees your iPhone by letting you do just about anything that is possible to do with your iPhone. Jailbreak at its essence is the purest manifestation of the will of the people. </p>
					<p>Yes, the App Store reflects well the imaginations and creativity of thousands of developers and iPhone users. Apple has done a brilliant job making the iPhone a blank slate that is able to continually mold to our collective conscience. Yet, iPhone can do and be so much more. Cue iPhone Jailbreak.</p>
